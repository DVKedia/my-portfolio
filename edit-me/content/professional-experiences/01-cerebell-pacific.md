I volunteered as part of the International Award for Young People (IAYP), where I actively engaged in community service, skill development, physical recreation, and an adventurous journey. Through this program, I contributed to meaningful social initiatives, developed leadership and teamwork skills, and challenged myself to step out of my comfort zone. This experience taught me the value of discipline, empathy, and resilience while making a positive impact on the community.
